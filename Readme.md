## About this repo

The repository is used to evaluate applicants in their frontend development skills (CSS + HTML).


## What to do (task description)

In the "source" folder you will find an example PSD for mobile devices. In this case for an iPhone 7 with 375x667 pixels. Your job is to convert the design into HTML + CSS. We attach great importance to pixel perfectness as well as for responsivesness (result should be scalable).

- Please create a new branch out of the applicants branch. 
- Create multiple commits (not only one big commit).
- Push the changes after you complete your work.
